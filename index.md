Invested at Mundi Ventures and briefly at In-Q-Tel, mostly in European and national security technology companies, respectively.

A non-profit emergency engineering company to re-engineer and quickly manufacture difficult-to-source PPE in California.

#### Engineering for national security
I built and used technology to advance US national security and foreign policy goals.
